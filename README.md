<h1>MagicRPG</h1>
<p>Adds a magic system to Minecraft. Adding spells for the player to learn and a leveling system to make spells more powerfull.</p>
<p>This magic system is rather basic. Players can find books that when used the player now knows the spell contained inside of it. Players can set a few spells to a hotbar to make casting them quick and easy. The player can level up various aspects of themselves. This allows the player to customize their build.</p>
