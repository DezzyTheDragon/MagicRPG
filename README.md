<h1>MagicRPG</h1>
<p>Adds a magic system to Minecraft. Adding spells for the player to learn and a leveling system to make spells more powerful.</p>
<p>This magic system is rather basic. Players can find books that when used the player learn the spell contained inside it. Players can set a few spells to a hotbar to make casting them quick and easy. The player can level up various aspects of themselves. This allows the player to customize their build.</p>
<p>The player can use the keys 'C' and 'V' to change the currently selected spell in the spell hot bar. Using a spell will cause the players' mana to deplete. When out the player can no longer cast spells. After a short amount of time with no casting spells the mana will start to regenerate.</p>
